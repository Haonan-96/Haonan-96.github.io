									<p>
									Evolution in music, quite a wide topic. Where should we start? First of all, by getting a wide dataset.  
									<strong>Rolling Stone</strong> magazine is going to help us. <strong>Rolling Stone</strong> 
									is an American monthly magazine that focuses on music,politics, and popular culture. 
									It was founded in San Francisco. The first magazine was released in 1967 
									and featured John Lennon on the cover and was published every two weeks ever since. It is known for 
									provocative photography and its cover photos, featuring musicians, politicians, athletes, and actors.

									In September 2021 they made a list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. More than 250 artists,
									writers, and industry figures helped choose a brand-new list full of historic favorites,
									world-changing anthems and new classics. Here you can see 
									<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/500-greatest-songs-voters-list-1225358/">how the 500 were selected</a> 
									Thanks to this list we have the favorite songs for the last 50 years along with the singer and 
									the year of production. So now it is time for some Social Graph magic!
									</p>

									<p>
									There are two main studies that we are going to perform. One is focused on genres 
									whereas the other one’s main subject is sentiment, singer’s feelings. Keep reading for both!
								    </p>

									<h3>GENRE EVOLUTION</h3>

									<p>
									Thanks to our 500 top songs list we know what are the most known artists of all time.
									Now what we need is to find out the artist’s genre information. Wikipedia pages will tell us.
									Some pages were not easy to access automatically. 
									So some magic-coding had to be done to extract the artists ourselves. 
								    </p>

									<p>
									Now we have the genders played by all the singers in the list. There are nearly 200 hundred! 
									The following graph shows the genres played by at least 10 artists.
