									<h3><strong>The 00's</strong></h3>

									<p>
										The turn of the millennium marked a time of possibility and uncertainty in equal measure. 
										Hopeful plans for the future combined with technological paranoia. 
										We may not have seen flying cars and alien contact, as previously envisioned, 
										but the Internet was starting to show its world-changing potential, reality TV 
										was altering our viewing habits and everyone was turning to mobile phones!
									</p>

									<p>
										The beginning of a century; were Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were still married 
										and Beyonce became The Diva, when Kylie Minogue returned to the show, 
										Billy Elliot got to our hearts and Coldplay inspired a whole generation… 
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/00-1.png" height='470' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										At a time when music TV channels were watched by millions, hip-hop stars with 
										big personalities stole the show. Sisqo’s ‘Thong Song’ was one of the year’s biggest hits. 
										It was the time of Eminem and Outkast. Missy Elliot still on the top! Pop backed up a bit 
										and we recovered the genres of the 70’s; rock and r&b lead the charts.  
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/00-2.png" height='550' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										It seems like the change of millennium did not bring new genres; 
										more likely it took us back to the old times!
									</p>

									<p>
										What will music in the next decade bring? Will it be completely separated like Brad and Jen? 
										Or will it continue like Beyonce to be the best Diva?
