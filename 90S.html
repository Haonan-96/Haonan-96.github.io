										<h2><strong>The 90's</strong></h2>
									</header>

										The 1990s was a decade where pop culture took flight, dance moves were born and 
										fast-food got even bigger. Friends and their 
										<a href="https://youtu.be/q-9kPks0IfE">I’ll be there for you</a> started 
										in this decade and they are still popular two decades later. 
										Did the same thing happen with music? Are the genres of this era still in use today? 
										Have the 90’s never ended?
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/90-1.jpg" height='500' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										The centrality of the graph of this decade reveals that hip hop is one of the most popular genres. 
										In Hip hop’s roots we can find pop, disco and soul music that have been starring in the 80’s. 
									</p>

									<span class="image centered"><img src="images/90-g.png" width='500' height='450' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										Hip hop is a culture movement  that was created by African and  Caribbean Americans in the Bronx. 
										This genre is characterized by four key elements: rapping, DJing, break dancing and graffiti. 
										It goes without saying that these elements have tremendously influenced the genres of today. 
										The mixture of reggaeton and rap gave trap, DJing+rap+Pop gave electronic music of today. 
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/90-2.png" height='500' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										The limits between rock and Pop in this decade are also blurry. 
										Green Day brought Punk rock which then was the base for Punk rock. 
										Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana are some that appear in the top of our list.
									</p>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/90-3.png" height='470' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										Lexically we can also see the expansion of Hip hop. Bad words start to come up, 
										more slang appear in our word clouds, terms like battle, scare face, enemy… stand out. 
										These terms cannot catch us by surprise; hip-hop often revendicates, 
										it is a fighting genre where they often talk about social problems, discrimination… 
										Another interesting detail of the word clouds formed is that there are a few Spanish words 
										which also makes sense as we have seen that hip hop was created by Central Americans.
									</p>

									<span class="image centered"><img src="images/90-4.jpg" width='500' height='350' alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										So, it looks like the 90’s never ended, but have new nodes been born?
